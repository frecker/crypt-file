1. crypt-file e <input_file> <output_file>

Enter a password. Afterwards the input_file is read, encrypted and
hashed with a hmac. The result is written to output_file.

2. crypt-file d <input_file> <output_file>

Enter a password. First, it is tested, whether the hmac is correct. If
this is the case, then the file is decrypted and the result is written
to output_file.
