1. You need the Haskell-Compiler ghc. If possible, you should install
it via your package-manager. If this is not possible (probable you are
using an operating-system without a package-manager), then you might
want to install the Haskell Platform, available at
https://www.haskell.org/downloads.

2. Try "make". If you happen to be missing some libraries, then these
commands should install the needed libraries:

$ cabal update
$ cabal install pbkdf
$ cabal install cipher-aes
$ cabal install crypto

3. Now "make" should compile the program.
